Centro de Apoyo al Estudiante de Física (CAE Physics) is a group of physics students from the Universidad Nacional Mayor San Marcos (UNMSM) in Lima, Peru. Our main objective is to provide academic resources to support the study of physics. As secondary objectives, but no less important, are to inform (through study guides), disseminate (through publications in social media) and encourage the study of physics.

To achieve these objectives, we opted for five strategies:

1. Design and maintain a website that compiles and showcases our work. See: Study Guides (Wikilinks), Library, relevant resources for a university student (scientific articles, web pages, Youtube channels, etc).
2. Write Study Guides (Wikilinks), specifying recommended books and Youtube channels for every academic course provided by the UNMSM.
3. Index and maintain a library with books categorised by academic year.
4. Disseminate academic information (such as Faculty of Physical Sciences communiqués, scholarships, etc.) that will influence students' achievement.
5. Disseminate multimedia content that encourages interest in physics as a science and potential career.
